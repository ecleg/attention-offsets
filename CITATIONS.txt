CITATIONS AND FORMULAS FOR AI IMPACT ANALYSIS

This document lists all sources and formulas used to generate the environmental and economic impact figures in impact.csv (output by CreditAnalysis370.py).
AI Assistance:
    Portions of code, all code for JSON parsing data extraction (AI is better at reading AI than me), and all code for HTML
    Research into the carbon market and AI systems energy consumption
    Verifying my calculations

CORE FORMULAS

1. Token Estimation
Formula: tokens = total_characters / 4
Rationale: OpenAI and industry standard heuristic for English text.
Source: OpenAI API documentation; see also QUICK_REFERENCE.md

2. Energy Consumption
Formula: watt_hours = tokens * 0.008
         kilowatt_hours = watt_hours / 1000
Rationale: Weighted average for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Llama.
Source: Luccioni et al. (2024); OpenAI Energy Disclosures (2024); Strubell et al. (2023)
Electric car fuel efficiency: Electric vehicle database, 2019

3. Carbon Footprint
Formula: kg_CO2e = kilowatt_hours * 0.35
Rationale: Server-side compute for prompts/responses, US grid/cloud provider average carbon intensity.
Source: EPA eGRID (2024); Microsoft Azure Sustainability Report (2024); Google Cloud Carbon Footprint Report (2024)
Important Note:
    What is not included in carbon footprint calculation:
        Model training footprint
        End‑user device energy and networking
        Hardware embodied carbon
        Water usage (factored in later)

4. Water Consumption
Formula: liters = kilowatt_hours * 1.8
Rationale: Data center cooling water intensity.
Source: Google Environmental Report (2024); Li et al. (2024); Microsoft Water Positive Commitment (2024)

5. Ad Revenue
Formula: impressions = user_prompts * 1.0
         revenue_usd = (impressions / 1000) * 2.50
Rationale: 1 ad per prompt, $2.50 CPM (cost per 1000 impressions).
Source: Industry baseline CPM for display ads (2024-2025)

6. Offset Cost
Formula: offset_cost_usd = kg_CO2e * 0.01
Rationale: Voluntary carbon market average price (2025).
Source: Gold Standard, VCS, voluntary market reports

6a. Water Offset Cost
Formula: offset_water_usd = liters * (water_price_per_1000_gal / (1000 * 3.785))
                water_price_per_1000_gal = 1.50 USD (baseline, non-regional)
Rationale: Water used in data center cooling is a separate environmental impact from carbon emissions. 
                     Offsetting water consumption funds restoration and efficiency programs that return water 
                     to stressed basins or reduce future data center water demand.
Source: Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) Water Restoration Certificates; 
                Gold Standard Water Benefit projects; The Nature Conservancy water funds; 
                corporate water restoration pricing surveys (2024-2025)
        
What Water Offset Funds Support:
    - Riparian habitat restoration (returns water to rivers/streams in stressed basins)
    - Agricultural-to-environmental water transfers
    - Municipal water efficiency retrofits (reduces demand, freeing water for ecosystems)
    - Wetland restoration and groundwater recharge projects
    - Data center closed-loop cooling R&D (reduces future freshwater withdrawal)

Important Note: Water offset cost is NOT included in the carbon footprint. Carbon and water are 
                                tracked separately. The "offset_cost" metric in impact.csv is the sum of both 
                                (carbon + water) to reflect total environmental restoration investment.

6b. Combined Offset Cost
Formula: offset_cost_combined = offset_carbon + offset_water
Rationale: Total environmental impact restoration cost (carbon + water).
Source: See above (6 and 6a)

7. Coverage Ratio
Formula: coverage = revenue_usd / offset_cost_usd
Rationale: Economic viability of ad-funded offset model.
Source: See above

8. Real-World Ad Impressions Equivalents
Instagram Reels: 1 ad per 4 minutes of scrolling (Instagram, 2024)
YouTube Shorts: 1 ad per 1 minute of scrolling (YouTube, 2024)
